 ya , did you ever see that movie ? i saw it and i like harrison ford who is in it , but it was pretty bad in my opinion 
 i did see the movie , i thought it was bad as well , i liked the book better , i like reading you can learn many interesting facts , like why the area code of new york is 212 .

 hi , yes i do . do you like music ? 
 very much , i was so excited to learn that "" /hybrid theory""from linkin park has been the best selling album in the 21st century ! ! 
 did you ever have any cassette tapes ? 
 yes , i had many and also vinyls and the cd 's 
 what di you do with all of those items ? i just threw away my cds about a month ago , at least the crappy ones . 
 i even remember the 78 rpm records , and i loved the books they cam in , they were sort of phtograph albums , with artist 's pictures , it was really cool ! 
 i wish the music had that today . i remember reading the cd jackets as soon as i got them . i can remember checking out artists mentioned in my favorite ablums . 
 that was a beautiful part of it . also really beautiful are soundtracks ! ! 
 spielberg played the clarinet on the jaws soundtrack ? ? ? ? how did i not know that ? 
 i did not know that either ! ! that is really neat . remember tarzan , i really loved phill collins performances for that movie ! ! 
 yeah . i think phil collins is seriously under rated . i think he is really talented . 
 yes i admire him a lot , and it is so cool that he recorded in 5 languages ! 
 batman begins must have been fun to record . the title of each track was the name of a genus of bat . 
 that is so neat ! those are details that make you enjoy the movies even more . did you watch tron , ? it has a unique soundtrack ! 
 i have not seen it . tell me about the soundtrack . 
 it is very sci fi , and super inspiring . it is made by daft punk , i love that duo ! 
 i love that they negotiated with their robot helmets on . seems like something they would do .

 well other countries apparently like it as well as there are copies in france and ireland apparently . 
 i guess we have a historical link with those countries . the president 's guest house is larger than the white house . i ’m surprised trump can stand the situation . he might have to add some stories to the white house . or maybe rent out the guest house . 
 like he needs more money though apparently he does not reach the top 3 in wealth , that would be jfk , washington and jefferson . 
 though not one of the top three richest presidents , maybe trump can be one of the top pop stars ever to hold office . the indonesian president released 3 pop albums while in office . maybe trump can get four albums out . he might need to get re - elected though . 
 i do n't know , i think i would rather have president banana from zimbabwe put out some tunes instead . 
 what nickname has trump earned ? ? until 1805 , the runner - up in a presidential election became vp . i think this system should be reinstated . the entertainment factor would be tremendous for a public starved for diversion . there 's not much getting done in government anyway . seems like a missed opportunity for some laugh 's 
 they may not appear to get anything done but they do own 86 % of the land of nevada , so they obviously did something right , haha .

 i am good , thank you . i enjoy travel . do you ? 
 i do but i am a worrying traveler . where is the best place you have been to ? 
 i have not been out of the country but several places in the country . i like chicago a lot . did you know that all of japans highways are tolls ? 
 that 's got ta be expensive ! what 's the best place in chicago ? where should i go when i visit ? 
 i like the natural history museum and millennium park . lou malnati 's has amazing pizza . it is very expensive to travel in japan . it costs more than $ 300 to travel across the country . 
 that 's a lot . i can not imagine having to pay that in tolls . i do like lou 's pizza . have you been to wrigley field ? i should ask first if you are a baseball fan ... 
 i have not . we did stop outside of soldier field but did n't get to go in . did you know that iceland has no public rail service ? 
 that 's odd . soldier field is just ok . the shedd is really good though . where else , besides chicago do you like going ? 
 i enjoyed the mountains of tennessee . they are beautiful . we got a cabin with an amazing view . i would go to a lot more places if you could get there faster . the dutch are working on that . they are creating a commuter bus that goes 160 mph . that would be great . 
 can you imagine the movie speed on that bus ! ! ! ! holy smokes ! 
 ha ha , yes that would change that movie quite a bit . back to iceland , most do n't have cars and travel between towns by flight ! 
 really . seems a little overkill but what do i know ... i want to go there and see the northern lights some day . 
 that would be a beautiful sight . off topic but how do you feel about sharks ? 
 i 'm for em !

 hello . speaking of chatting , i recently learned that the bars of service on a cell phone have absolutely nothing to do with the connection quality . now that 's surprising . 
 does n't sound right ;) so what do they stand for ? 
 i 'm not sure . does n't make sense to me . cell phones have been around longer than we thought . in the 1930 's , an actress named hedy lamarr helped to invent wifi , the cellphone and gigs . that s surprising ! 
 actress ? i wonder how she did that ... 
 pretty amazing , huh ? almost as amazing as the world record for the price of a violin bow is over $ 182,000 . it was made out of gold and tortoiseshell !

 i concur . these are not the best people . 
 i love that the judge told him that bipolar does not excuse his behavior . 
 his excuse was such a joke . no one will believe that for sure 
 even his prepared statements sound so hollow . it is like a regurgitation of ever statement where people have got caught doing something wrong and want to manipulate their way out of punishment .

 i have no idea , i think ja rule probably did not know the information beforehand . 
 it would have been nice if they had named the people who were scammed out of 1.2 million to give us an insight to how deep this attempt to defraud went .

 no i do n't tend to read much about it unless it is front of me like this article .

 i think he should have gotten 20 years and be forced to return every cent he collected . what do you think ?

 i do n't think i have heard of them . i have heard that one of the directors recently passed away , and his last film was nominated for an academy award 
 yeah , sadly , disney ( which owns the american rights to the films ) does n't tend to promote them very much . i think they 're worried they 'll cut into their "" home grown "" market . anyway , dunno if you even like animated movies , but they 're worth checking out . 
 i do n't watch them very often . apparently there was a showing of the recent film in a park in d.c . that 's one u.s . city i have n't been to 
 sadly , i have n't been to dc either , although i 've always wanted to visit there . apparently there 's a lot of interesting going down this summer . they 're having a crab feast at the navy - marine corps stadium . they 'll have 100 gallons of crab soup ! can you imagine that much soup ? 
 i recently met a girl who lives in that area , and she said the nightlife is worth visiting for . it sounds like many of the events feature jazz music . do you listen to jazz very often ? 
 a little bit , i 'm not too familiar with it . i know is originated in new orleans and a little bit about the history , but that 's about it . heard clint eastwood is a big jazz fan , thought that was pretty interesting .. 
 there 's many different styles , probably derived from the various regions in the us where it has taken root . kansas city is another place where it has prominence

 that is interesting . i have n't been to a live concert recently , but i want to many when i was younger . most of them were in smaller venues though . 
 it 's been awhile since i 've been to any as well . got a friend of mine he 's big into the ramones and seen them in concert a few times . get this , they 've played a total of 2,263 concerts , touring almost non - stop for over twenty years . now that 's dedication to your music ! 
 i can only imagine how exhausting that must be as well . sometimes i think it would be cool to travel to some of the ancient amphitheaters to see what they 're like . pink floyd once recorded a live concert with no audience in a roman one in pompeii 
 wonder why the did it without an audience ? pretty sure people would have shown if they 're heard about it . must be one of those "" eccentric rock and roll musician "" things . wonder how a concert would sound held in an old amphitheater ...

 now that i think about it , i went to one a little over a year ago around christmastime , so most of the songs were christmas songs . the venue was fairly big , but not as big as ones like where the big name artists perform . it was good still , unlike the 2002 creed concert that was bad enough for concert goers to file a lawsuit 

",New Human Generated,yeah i heard about that ! i wonder how bad that concert must have been .,"in 2002 a creed concert was so bad that four concert goers filed a lawsuit against the band
