 that 's what people seem to be saying everywhere , but i do n't know . they have gotten through scandals and issues before . i 'm not counting them out yet . 
 what about the problems with the ncaa though ? the nfl needs the players . 
 i get that and it is valid , but it 's like any sport . if 1 person quits , there are 5 waiting to take their place . if players do n't want to play , then they should move along . 
 what about the fans though . people might get bored of a game when the quality goes down . 
 that is true . everything runs in cycles though . i liken it to a losing team having an empty stadium and a winning team selling out . fans are fickle . their ... our views are important , but we come and go . 
 i wonder whether letting women into the game would create interest , get more fans . 
 oh , it absolutely would . it would be like ... and i know i am going to butcher the name here , but when manon reheaume played in the nhl . my only concern is that if mishandled it might come off like a gimmick . 
 i see your point . long term , will women stay ? true . 
 i feel like ... there are enough talented women athletes out there , that a woman kicker or qb is possible , perhaps a wide receiver . 
 women can be tough too . would a coach like bill belichick hire a woman if she could help him win the super bowl ? 
 this is going to come off sounding bad , but it is n't meant to . i think anyone in the front office would look at it from the perspective of generating revenue and views . the sponsors would love the coverage . 
 belichick has done well in the post season , so i think he 's looking at it from a strategic point of view . the sponsors would tie her presence into a bunch of social issues and products .

 oh i guess baseball . although i do n't have time to see many games anymore . 
 baseball is the american pastime . japanese are surprised to discover this fact . 
 yeah , i guess they see it as being their own . they have their own fan culture around it . what is your favorite sport ? 
 i like both baseball and football , but i usually follow them around playoff time . do n't have much time for games . 
 yeah the seasons are so long that it 's tough to get really immersed . especially baseball . it 's what , 162 games ? 
 162 , plus playoffs . soon they 'll be playing until christmas . until 2005 , a married couple scheduled all the games for the mlb . they must have had special software or something . 
 yeah . although i think they had done it since the 80s . maybe they did the first few seasons on a commodore 64 lol ? 
 the old c64 ! classic . i do n't remember any good sports games on that though . football , baseball , soccer . probably not easy to do on a c64 . 
 yeah . i know they had accounting software lol , my dad used it . we had the minnesota fats pool game and i think one soccer one . but it was such a different era . no madden style graphics 
 i wonder whether they had a version of kickball on the c64 . the canadians call the game soccer - baseball . 
 yeah i 've read that somewhere . when i was a kid , we played a kind of kickball called rounders at camp . our counselor was english . he kept telling us "" run to fourth ! "" and we were like , "" you mean home ? run home ? "" 
 baseball is american ! i do n't know the english would want with it . i bet the english do n't collect "" rounders "" cards the way we collect baseball cards .

 some guy found $ 3 million dollars of baseball cards from the 1900s . i wonder what he did with the money . 
 yeah . that 's an amazing find . i heard they had been hidden since the 40s .

72,72,"- that the highest score ever in a football game occurred in 1916 when georgia tech defeated cumberland 222 - 0
","hi ! do you follow football ? 
 sorry , i ca n't say that i do , i'm familiar with the big stories , but that is it . 
 that is about how much i know , just the basics , and some fun trivia . 
 i used to live in dc son kind of know the redskins , but alex smith is new to me , is he the quarterback ? 
 yes . he took so many ap classes in high school he entered college as a junior , he started working on a masters then . 
 now that is impressive , you have this impression of sports players as jocks , but he transcends that stereotype . 
 he really does , he was drafted as a number one pick in 2005 too . 
 do you go to football games ? i 've been to one once in my life at indiana university . 
 i ve been to quite a few at florida state , but no pro games . there is only 11 minutes of live action anyway 
 i think that is what puts me off , i really do n't have time to sit in front of the tv for three hours , and then for only 11 minutes of play . 
 it is hard to find time for that , i do nt know how some people do it all day , on a weekly basis . 
 i guess some people listen to games on the radio , difficult to see how that works . 
 i ve done it traveling , you ve got to really know the team and all of the players names . it was so much harder . 
 do you have a favorite nfl team . like i said , i lived in dc for a while so kind of follow them . now in northern ohio , the browns are a difficult team to support . 
 i feel you there , living in florida here . dolphins are hard to root for and feel proud .

","hi ! do you follow football ? 
 sorry , i ca n't say that i do , i'm familiar with the big stories , but that is it . 
 that is about how much i know , just the basics , and some fun trivia . 
 i used to live in dc son kind of know the redskins , but alex smith is new to me , is he the quarterback ? 
 yes . he took so many ap classes in high school he entered college as a junior , he started working on a masters then . 
 now that is impressive , you have this impression of sports players as jocks , but he transcends that stereotype . 
 he really does , he was drafted as a number one pick in 2005 too . 
 do you go to football games ? i 've been to one once in my life at indiana university . 
 i ve been to quite a few at florida state , but no pro games . there is only 11 minutes of live action anyway 
 i think that is what puts me off , i really do n't have time to sit in front of the tv for three hours , and then for only 11 minutes of play . 
 it is hard to find time for that , i do nt know how some people do it all day , on a weekly basis . 
 i guess some people listen to games on the radio , difficult to see how that works . 
 i ve done it traveling , you ve got to really know the team and all of the players names . it was so much harder . 
 do you have a favorite nfl team . like i said , i lived in dc for a while so kind of follow them . now in northern ohio , the browns are a difficult team to support .

90,90,"[ # 26 score:167 comments:24 ] - til - the trunk of your car is called that because old cars used to have wooden trunks on the back .
","did you know that there was a moral panic in the 1700 's because everyone was reading books ? haha 
 i did nt know that lol . we sure are close to a moral panic with all the tablets and social media kids and adults are using . 
 haha ya , if people started reading a lot in this day and age society would think that was a wonderful thing ! haha 
 yeah , that would be great , literature is getting lost and great authors like cs lewis and tolkien are getting forgotten . 
 right , i think it 's funny though that they used to read off bad poetry and whoever laughed first would lose , that s hilarious 
 that is hilarious i wonder who is the champion among them lol , do you personally like to read ? 
 i ca n't say that i do no , i do like audiobooks , i did try to speed read once but i found i did n't retain any information from it , that 's why i do n't know what to make of the speed reading champion with 4,700 words per minute 
 i wonder how they measure that , i can just skip pages and tell everybody that i read the content , i bet i could read 6000 words per minute that way 
 ya exactly , if i could just flip through pages i could speed read too , what is weird is starship troopers is on the military 's reading list , idk about the book but the movie is definitely not pro military 
 i guess that s because movies are nt as good as movies , a lot of info is missing , the enders game book is also another recommendation for armed forces around the globe 
 ya , did you ever see that movie ? i saw it and i like harrison ford who is in it , but it was pretty bad in my opinion 
 i did see the movie , i thought it was bad as well , i liked the book better , i like reading you can learn many interesting facts , like why the area code of new york is 212 . 
 ya i think it was because that was the fastest number that you could dial with a rotary phone ? crazy how that stuff carries over until even today ! ! 
 it is ! there s a lot things we need to discover still though , i 'm kind of worried the cables carrying phone and internet are underwater , at least some of them .

107,107,"[ # 26 score:167 comments:24 ] - til - the trunk of your car is called that because old cars used to have wooden trunks on the back .
","did you know that there was a moral panic in the 1700 's because everyone was reading books ? haha 
 i did nt know that lol . we sure are close to a moral panic with all the tablets and social media kids and adults are using . 
 haha ya , if people started reading a lot in this day and age society would think that was a wonderful thing ! haha 
 yeah , that would be great , literature is getting lost and great authors like cs lewis and tolkien are getting forgotten . 
 right , i think it 's funny though that they used to read off bad poetry and whoever laughed first would lose , that s hilarious 
 that is hilarious i wonder who is the champion among them lol , do you personally like to read ? 
 i ca n't say that i do no , i do like audiobooks , i did try to speed read once but i found i did n't retain any information from it , that 's why i do n't know what to make of the speed reading champion with 4,700 words per minute 
 i wonder how they measure that , i can just skip pages and tell everybody that i read the content , i bet i could read 6000 words per minute that way 
 ya exactly , if i could just flip through pages i could speed read too , what is weird is starship troopers is on the military 's reading list , idk about the book but the movie is definitely not pro military 
 i guess that s because movies are nt as good as movies , a lot of info is missing , the enders game book is also another recommendation for armed forces around the globe

","hi , do you like music ? 
 hi , yes i do . do you like music ? 
 very much , i was so excited to learn that "" /hybrid theory""from linkin park has been the best selling album in the 21st century ! ! 
 did you ever have any cassette tapes ? 
 yes , i had many and also vinyls and the cd 's 
 what di you do with all of those items ? i just threw away my cds about a month ago , at least the crappy ones . 
 i even remember the 78 rpm records , and i loved the books they cam in , they were sort of phtograph albums , with artist 's pictures , it was really cool ! 
 i wish the music had that today . i remember reading the cd jackets as soon as i got them . i can remember checking out artists mentioned in my favorite ablums . 
 that was a beautiful part of it . also really beautiful are soundtracks ! ! 
 spielberg played the clarinet on the jaws soundtrack ? ? ? ? how did i not know that ? 
 i did not know that either ! ! that is really neat . remember tarzan , i really loved phill collins performances for that movie ! ! 
 yeah . i think phil collins is seriously under rated . i think he is really talented . 
 yes i admire him a lot , and it is so cool that he recorded in 5 languages ! 
 batman begins must have been fun to record . the title of each track was the name of a genus of bat . 
 that is so neat ! those are details that make you enjoy the movies even more . did you watch tron , ? it has a unique soundtrack ! 
 i have not seen it . tell me about the soundtrack . 
 it is very sci fi , and super inspiring . it is made by daft punk , i love that duo ! 
 i love that they negotiated with their robot helmets on . seems like something they would do .

","the white house is at 1600 pennsylvania avenue in washington d.c . and has been there since 1800 and i have never been . have you ? 
 i 've never been , though i want to go.the white house seems behind the curve technologically . w. had solar panels put back on the white house . reagan had them taken off . i wonder why clinton did n’t put them back on . floppy disks ? i wonder if they have laser printers yet . or mice . 
 well other countries apparently like it as well as there are copies in france and ireland apparently . 
 i guess we have a historical link with those countries . the president 's guest house is larger than the white house . i ’m surprised trump can stand the situation . he might have to add some stories to the white house . or maybe rent out the guest house . 
 like he needs more money though apparently he does not reach the top 3 in wealth , that would be jfk , washington and jefferson . 
 though not one of the top three richest presidents , maybe trump can be one of the top pop stars ever to hold office . the indonesian president released 3 pop albums while in office . maybe trump can get four albums out . he might need to get re - elected though . 
 i do n't know , i think i would rather have president banana from zimbabwe put out some tunes instead .

 i have no idea but would love to know . 
 there are over 7 million animal species on our planet , insects contribute 1 million to that number 
 wow . that 's a lot . i thought there would be a lot less than that . is there anything else you were surprised to read about in the article ? 
 the amount of living animals on the planet currently is 20 quintillion ! how fascinating ! 
 you 're right , that is fascinating . i just found out that jupiter has radio storms so strong that they can be picked up and heard by an am radio . 
 wow ! i am curious to try that and to see if it works . do you know of any other fun facts about jupiter ? 
 yes , according to canadian law , all radios are required to have at least 40 % of the music played be canadian . 
 interesting . i would not think that there was even that much music to play . do you know of any canadian musicians ? 
 yes , nickleback and avril lavigne ... and sorry , that was not about jupiter ... 
 it was about radios though which is very interesting . did you know that soldiers in world war ii made radios from razorblades and pencils ? 
 i did not . i thought it would have been more sophisticated than that . there is a website where you can listen to thousands of episodes of classic radio dramas for free

 there are over 7 million animal species on our planet , insects contribute 1 million to that number 
 wow . that 's a lot . i thought there would be a lot less than that . is there anything else you were surprised to read about in the article ? 
 the amount of living animals on the planet currently is 20 quintillion ! how fascinating ! 
 you 're right , that is fascinating . i just found out that jupiter has radio storms so strong that they can be picked up and heard by an am radio . 
 wow ! i am curious to try that and to see if it works . do you know of any other fun facts about jupiter ? 
 yes , according to canadian law , all radios are required to have at least 40 % of the music played be canadian . 
 interesting . i would not think that there was even that much music to play . do you know of any canadian musicians ? 
 yes , nickleback and avril lavigne ... and sorry , that was not about jupiter ... 
 it was about radios though which is very interesting . did you know that soldiers in world war ii made radios from razorblades and pencils ? 
 i did not . i thought it would have been more sophisticated than that . there is a website where you can listen to thousands of episodes of classic radio dramas for free

 no i have n't . i heard it was good . 
 i have not yet either but i am aware of it 's cultural impact . it was made from a novel . apparently it is a very good romantic comedy . 
 my mother like it . i think it stars michelle yeoh , henry golding and constance wu , right ? 
 it does . apparently the basic premise is that a woman is engaged to a man and when she goes to meet his family discovers that he is insanely wealthy . his mother rejects her due to her less affluent background . 
 if i remember correctly , jon m chu is the director . 
 yes he is . it was also the first movie to feature an all - asian cast in hollywood in more than 20 years which is quite the accomplishment and i 'm glad that it did well . asians seem very underrepresented in film . 
 the movie is 121 minutes long , which is just right and is pg-13 . 
 that makes it accessible to a bigger audience which is good because then more asian - americans can see themselves represented on screen . 
 well , lets switch topics . are you a science person . , earth is the 3rd planet from the sun . it is also the only astronomical object known to harbor life . 
 i am a little . i enjoy learning about it . i was aware of those facts . i also know that if we viewed the entire earth 's history as a 24 hour period , humans would only represent 1 minute and 17 seconds of that day . that is a mind blowing stat . 
 this is mind blowing . thank god for jupiter . it saves earth from a lot of asteroids heading toward us . 
 that is really surprising since that planet is mostly compromised of gas . we do not even know if there is any solid land there . i wonder how it takes the impact first in this case ? 
 it 's very interesting . so is the fact that the sun is 4x less dense than earth . 
 i know it is much larger but i do n't think it has any solidity to it so that 's interesting . another science fact is that when earth was formed a day was only 5.5 hours long . 
 i did n't know that . i wonder why . there is a place on earth where there is less gravity than the rest of the planet . it is the hudson bay region of canada . 
 i wonder how much affect that has ? is it enough to change weights in any way ? i wonder . i do also know that we are running out of helium and will essentially be out of the gas by the end of the 21st century .

","did you see crazy rich asians ? 
 no i have n't . i heard it was good . 
 i have not yet either but i am aware of it 's cultural impact . it was made from a novel . apparently it is a very good romantic comedy . 
 my mother like it . i think it stars michelle yeoh , henry golding and constance wu , right ? 
 it does . apparently the basic premise is that a woman is engaged to a man and when she goes to meet his family discovers that he is insanely wealthy . his mother rejects her due to her less affluent background . 
 if i remember correctly , jon m chu is the director . 
 yes he is . it was also the first movie to feature an all - asian cast in hollywood in more than 20 years which is quite the accomplishment and i 'm glad that it did well . asians seem very underrepresented in film . 
 the movie is 121 minutes long , which is just right and is pg-13 . 
 that makes it accessible to a bigger audience which is good because then more asian - americans can see themselves represented on screen .

","are you interested in government related policy 
 i ca n't believe how much of a disaster the festival was . 
 yeah , i can not believe it either 
 i think for the level of this fraud they should have levied the maximum sentence requested . 
 i concur . these are not the best people . 
 i love that the judge told him that bipolar does not excuse his behavior . 
 his excuse was such a joke . no one will believe that for sure 
 even his prepared statements sound so hollow . it is like a regurgitation of ever statement where people have got caught doing something wrong and want to manipulate their way out of punishment . 
 even with the best lawyer , he will never and ever get away such hideous crime 
 i wonder why as a co founder ja rule was not charged . 
 i have no idea , i think ja rule probably did not know the information beforehand . 
 it would have been nice if they had named the people who were scammed out of 1.2 million to give us an insight to how deep this attempt to defraud went . 
 i think because of privacy or personal issues that they do not want to release such information . do you keep track of celebrity news by any chance 
 no i do n't tend to read much about it unless it is front of me like this article . 
 okay . do you believe what is the max sentence and fine should this guy get ? 
 i think he should have gotten 20 years and be forced to return every cent he collected . what do you think ? 
 completely with you on this . to warn others from carrying out such act .

 i think that it is a reminder of books that have been banned in the past for their controversial content , i remember it during my childhood 
 are n't most of those books now bestsellers ? i see the point of the event , but maybe it should be renamed to better reflect their current status 
 yes i think you 're right , how often do you go to the library btw ? 
 not very often since most of what i borrow through my library are ebooks and audiobooks . i love that i can access things right on my phone , though i do miss the feel of paper books 
 well i do wish that my library were more like the sacramento public library , you can read things like sewing machines from there which seems very useful to me 
 true ! it would be nice just to be able to borrow something like that that i would n't need to own . hopefully that idea becomes more popular in the coming years 
 i hope so . what do you think about william gladstone ? he took a wheelbarrow full of books at the age of 85 and random all the way to donate to his local library lol

 i think it encourages writers in their country , that 's for sure ! i would love to have that incentive to write and publish a book 
 well you should do a children 's book then , because they will buy 1,500 of them instead of just the 1,000 lol
